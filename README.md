🍼 Baby Food Schedule Dashboard (Power BI / Tableau Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project visualizes a baby's daily feeding habits, meal variety, and overall health remarks using an interactive dashboard.
The goal is to help caregivers and parents understand feeding frequency, nutrition variety, and trends in baby health over time.

🎯 Objectives

Track feeding frequency trends and visualize daily eating patterns.

Identify the most common meal types (Lunch, Snack, Dinner).

Analyze how remarks (Good / Moderate / Poor) change over time.

Discover feeding time distribution and highlight peak feeding periods.

Combine all insights into one interactive daily summary dashboard.
